-setup
  -move creation tasks to a .js file (not shell scripts)
  -create user and database : database_creation.sql
  -log in as user and set up database : database_setup.sql
  -configure Redis (redis.conf?)
    -incl. auth (see http://redis.io/topics/security)

-update or insert in Postgres? Is this behavior necessary? For which endpoints?

-stream results from Postgres? Use package node-pg-query-stream?

-friend deletion triggers:
  -delete relevant book requests
  -if currently borrowing:
    -borrower can't cancel friendship
    -loaner can (but this should probably be handled by the program)

-revise server API:

/api/trans

  /request         POST   : create  outgoing book request
  /request/:copyID DELETE : cancel  outgoing book request
  /deny            POST   : deny    incoming book request
  /checkout        POST   : approve incoming book request, loan out book
  /checkin         POST   : lent book is returned to the user

/api/books

  /          POST   :
  /:copyID   DELETE :
  /available GET    :

/api/self

  /          GET    :
  /          DELETE :
  /books            :
