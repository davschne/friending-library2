A web application that fosters the social aspect of reading, Friending Library lets users loan and borrow books and provides an easy-to-use interface for tracking these transactions.

The backend, written for Node using Express, uses PostgreSQL as the main data store and Redis for in-memory cache. The frontend is built in Angular, with routing provided by AngularUI Router.
